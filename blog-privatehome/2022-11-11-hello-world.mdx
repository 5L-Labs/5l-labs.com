Respect to the makers and tinkers working to make Technology free and private.

The focus of this stack are for the class of IT worker with less time to understand the beauty of the low-level implementation than the smart-home-function they would like to accomplish. Over the course of 2022, the goal is to publish blueprints of “How I did that?” with the goal to incorporate a “Hey Jimmy” home assistant.

For the Electricians and hobbyists that are looking to differentiate themselves in the market, we offer training and support on how to choose, configure, install and support smart home technology.

Updates will be sparse. We still have day jobs.
