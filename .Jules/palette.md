## 2025-02-18 - Generic "Read More" Links
**Learning:** Generic "Read More" links are problematic for screen reader users as they often navigate by links list, leaving them with multiple "Read More" links and no context.
**Action:** Always include an `aria-label` providing specific context, e.g., "Read more about [Post Title]", when the link text itself is generic.
