## 2025-02-18 - [Render Security Headers for Docusaurus]
**Vulnerability:** Default Render configuration for static sites lacks HSTS and CSP headers, leaving the site vulnerable to MITM and XSS/Injection.
**Learning:** Docusaurus sites on Render require explicit header configuration in `render.yaml`. CSP must account for inline scripts (Docusaurus hydration) and external services (GA, GTM, Google Fonts, Iconify).
**Prevention:** Use the `headers` block in `render.yaml` with a carefully scoped CSP and HSTS.
