## To be updated
The [AI Engineering Summit](https://www.ai.engineer/) was a definite eye-opener to the speed with which IT is transforming mundane "busy" work, and the startup cost for exploring new ideas.


### Take aways for a private agent:
* Do Agents need to be local to be private?
 * Locally on a macbookpro
 * Hosted in a secure enclave on AWS / Azure / GCP
* Or can some sort of formal proof be done to leave a multi-tenant agent in the cloud with data privacy?
* For either of the above, how to manage the balance of cost ?
* How are we protecting state?
* Where are we storing state?

Base Research for a federated system of local agents:
* [Model Control Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)
 * See AI Entourage
* FP32->FP8(FP1 for MoE) and Lora to shrink the model size, improve inference speed, reduce latency, increase throughput, and reduce cost


### Outstanding Details

- Outstanding documentation Items
- Add more details about the network architecture
